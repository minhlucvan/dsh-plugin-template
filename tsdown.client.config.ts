 * Build the browser face separately from the host entries.

 * that must be CJS — the host's ModuleLoader hands the module a CommonJS-shaped
 * `require` — and it must bundle for a browser target with `react` and
 * `react/jsx-runtime` left external, because the host supplies those, not this
 * package.
 *
 * `lib/client.cjs` is an intermediate: `scripts/wrap-client.mjs` turns it into
 * the self-registering `lib/client.js` the host actually serves.
